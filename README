I compiled bits and pieces of information around the internet to come up with this algorithm. I mostly followed the algorithm from stack overflow. It was pretty hard to read and not so clear what some of the parts meant. I filled in the gaps and got the converter performing decently. It is fully parenthesis capable. It can convert tons of expressions. I am having a bit of problem with chained + operators separtered by operators of higher precednece, they seam to get lost in the stack. Other then that I have not seen anything. I just got this working so expect things to go wrong :D The simple stuff is good enouph for my simply GA experiment with dlacewell.
